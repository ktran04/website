        <p className="mt-4 text-neutral-300 max-w-5xl">I am a Computer Science student at Georgia Tech concentrating in Cybersecurity and Information Internetworks with a minor in Leadership Studies, graduating in May 2026. </p>
        <p>At my NCR Atleos internship, I gained hands-on experience in platform engineering using Azure to automate secure device provisioning and centralize management while also learning to deploy security policies through Group Policies.
        During my internship at a startup beeco in Hungary, I worked as a technology consultant to design a roadmap for an AI-powered recommendation system (content-based + collaborative filtering) to personalize user experience, and conducted competitive gap analysis to identify feature adoption and partnership opportunities with international companies.</p>
        <p>My projects span phishing detection, embedded systems vulnerability research, and android app development, where I‚Äôve used software development tools like Java, Python, and React as well as security tools like Burp Suite, Wireshark, and Ghidra.
        On Georgia Tech's campus, I serve as a Teaching Assistant for CS Ethics, Resident Assistant for GT Housing, and Piccolo Section Leader for the Marching Band, developing leadership and mentorship skills by guiding peers academically, socially, and musically.
        Passionate about software engineering and cybersecurity, I enjoy building and deploying security systems.</p>
